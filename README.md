# Description
  Store owners would like to be able to view, access, and alter their inventory. This back end organizes products, tags, and categories for the store. It uses product tag to connect products and tags so that customers can more easily find products that fit what they're looking for. It gives the ability to delete or edit any existing category, product, or tag, should the store owner alter any of the inventory.
